# Dicee-Game

Made a game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It has two dice and two players. Every time we refresh the webpage the two dice gets a random number on it. The dice which gets a number larger than the other that player wins. If dice 1 has greater than number than dice 2 then player 1 wins.

For example In dice 1 the number appears 4 and as in dice 2 the number appears is 3 then in this case Player 1 wins.
